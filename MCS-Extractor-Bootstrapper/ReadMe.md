*Bootstrapper Project*

Note that this folder should contain:
* The postgresql windows executable from https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads
* The psqlodbc windows executable from https://odbc.postgresql.org/

These are not included in the project to save on painful repository management and because creating the bootstrapper probably _should_ be a manual step.
